# Filter.Regeneration
Liquid Argon Filter Regeneration Process  
## Pertinent Warnings  
### Evacuating the Vessel
Never run both the turbo and the roughing pump on the same volume at the same time  
The "bleed in valve"is a percision valve should be handled very delicately and will need to be turned several times to open and close it all the way  
When the screw is all the way at the bottom the valve is CLOSED  
When the screw is at the top the valve is all the way OPEN  
Ensure all valves are closed when starting the pump with the exception of those outlined  
Avoid opening the system to outside pressure. Carefully check and double check when you are opening up valves to evacuate the vessel  
### Running the Heater Tape   
When attaching the tape, the tape should not be overlapping at any point  
The thermocouple regulator must be installed inbetween the heater tape and the steel  
The temperature can be set on the current regulator. The limit should be set to 180 C
### Turbo Evactuating System  
The turbo runs at very high rpm. If the system were to suddenly be exposed to high pressure (atmosphere) or be shaken there is a risk that the vacuum could fail catastrophically (blow up)  
Take special care not to disturb the vacuum too much when the turbo is on and be extra careful not to accidentally open a valve that you shouldn’t  
When in doubt, turn the turbo off, wait till the blades spin all the way down, then perform whatever task you need to do  
You NEVER want to operate the Ion Gauge if the pressure in the system is above 5 mTorr  
The ion gauge SHOULD NOT be left on for long periods of time (e.g. > 1 hour) as it will destroy the gauge
The goal is to run the turbo until the system achieves at least 10-5 torr  
9.0 10-5 torr is fine  
2.0 10-5 torr is better  
10-6 torr is best  
This can take up to 6 hours if the system hasn’t been pumped down for a while.  
It is ok to leave the system unattended while it pumps  
Be sure to turn the ion gauge off  
Press the menu button  
Use the arrows to select “IG off”  
Press enter  
### Attach Ar/H Tanks and Vents  
IMPORTANT: THE Ar/H BOTTLE MUST BE ATTACHED TO EITHER THE WALL, THE BOTTLE CART, OR SOME OTHER STURDY STRUCTURE TO PREVENT THE BOTTLE FROM FALLING OVER. NEVER USE A BOTTLE UNLESS IT IS ANCHORED!!!  
The threads on this adapter to the bottle are “left handed” threads. This means that you rotate counterclockwise to tighten and clockwise to loosen (opposite of normal)  
Be Careful not to strip the threads, brass can deform very easily  
These hoses are VCR ¼ inch hoses and need VCR ¼ inch gaskets (small metal disks) at the joints and to be tightened very well.  
You will not want to leave the system closed for long (> 30 mins) with the heater tapes on and the system isolated like this  
Only turn on the RGA if the pressure reads < 10-4 torr on the ion gauge  
### Starting the Regeneration Process
When starting the regeneration process, you will want to be sure the valve which allows the Ar/H to flow into the system to be open  
This pressure should be below 700 torr  
Pressure near the filter between 400 - 700 Torr (500 torr is ideal)
Pressure near the turbo pump below 10-4 Torr (somewhere around 10-5 Torr is ideal)
The Ar/H flow rate between 10 and 30 CFH (20 - 25 CFH is ideal)
The goal is to get the water level to ~10-6
Oxygen should stay below 10-6
### Steps to end the run
Shut off the Ar/H (close the regulator)  
Close the Ar/H bottle  
Close the rig to the outside world  
stop run and turn off filament   
isolate the RGA from the system  
turn off the heater tapes (unplug them)  
Open the Ar/H (open the regulator)  
Letting the pressure in the system pump out  
Turn off the ion gauge  
Shut off the system   
Turn off the Motor pump  
Turn off the RGA  
Shut off the Pumping Station
