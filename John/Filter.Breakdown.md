The filter is very simply constructed.  
There are two layers of catalyst inside:  
- The activated copper on the top half
- The molecular sieve on the bottom half  

The activated copper is a small, dark pellet  
The molecular sieve is a somewhat smaller white bead with tiny spots  
The copper isn't separated from the sieve in any way; they are simply allowed to mingle.  
There is a mesh on top of the filer tube  
Presumably, there is a similar mesh on the bottom to prevent the material from falling out. However, we didn't take apart that part of the filter during our breakdown, so I can't confirm.  
The thermocouple sits in the top half of the catalyst material.  
It has two wires that run through the mesh to a connector on top of the flange.  
A long metal rod, which is the thermocouple itself, is buried in the copper catalyst.  
During assembly, the thermocouple is lowered into the vaccum tube, and the activated copper pellets are poured in around it.  
The density of the material keeps the thermocouple solidly held in place, so during dissasembly, the activated copper had to be evacuated (poured out) in order to remove the thermocouple.  
In our dissasembly process, we first closed off the valves connecting the filter to the rest of the system.  
__Warning:__  
- Regenerated copper should __not__ be exposed to the air.  
- The material's reaction with the air is exothermic, and could start a fire or expand rapidly (explode).  
- Only remove the catalyst if it has been used, i.e __after__ the filtration process and __before__ regeneration.  
    
Then, we opened the input valve, which was open to the air, in order to bring the filter to atmospherice pressure.  
Next, we unbolted the flange to remove the filter assembly from the system.  
At this point, we unbolted the flanges at the top of the filter in order to look at it from the top. This step is unnecessary in future dissasembly.  
In order to remove the thermocouple, we then unbolted the filter at the flange in the middle, where the two catalysts meet.  
The top half of the assembly was slowly raised up, and the catalyst material flowed out.  
We used a funnel to capture the catalyst in a safe container.  
The top half of the filter is fairly heavy, so it's important to take care when handling it. Two people or some other form of assistance are advisable.  
In future dissasemblies, it may be wise to pour out the catalyst from the entire filter as one piece.  
Though the filter assembly is quite heavy, and the shifting weight of the catalyst pouring out will be difficult to control, pouring through the top instead of allowing catalyst to escape through the middle joint should be much cleaner and easier.
